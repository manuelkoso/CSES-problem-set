# CSES-problem-set

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [CSES problem set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).

I use the following books to (try to) solve these problems and in general to study algorithm design:

1. The Algorithm Design (Third edition) - Steven S. Skiena
2. Guide to Competitive Programming - Antti Laaksonen
